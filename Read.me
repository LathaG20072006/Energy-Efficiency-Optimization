Source Code Snippet (Sample)
from scipy.optimize import minimize
def energy_consumption(x):
power, time = x
return power * time # Energy in Watt-hours
def constraint_energy_min(x):
return x[0] * x[1] - 100 # Minimum energy need
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint_energy_min})
bounds = [(10, 100), (1, 10)] # Power and Time bounds
x0 = [20, 5] # Initial guess
result = minimize(energy_consumption, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
if result.success:
print("Optimization successful!")
print(f"Optimal Power: {result.x[0]:.2f} W")
print(f"Optimal Time: {result.x[1]:.2f} hours")
print(f"Minimum Energy: {energy_consumption(result.x):.2f} Wh")
else:
print("Optimization failed:", result.message)
